# The Story of Education in Colorado

#### Problem Statement
What is the state of education in Colorado currently and can it be improved for vulnerable students?

#### Context
The state board of education wants to make data-driven decisions to improve studentâ€™s performance and college-readiness. They are seeking fresh perspectives, so they have made data available for outside parties to create stories from.

#### Success Criteria
In our story, we will produce a visually engaging presentation that explains how schools in the state have been performing, makes recommendations for outreach programs for students in minorities and lower-income brackets, demonstrates if expenditures have an affect on performance, and identifies patterns of performance in the statement.

#### Scope
The goal of the project is only to create a story of how performance got to where it is today and to identify possible leads for how it could be better tomorrow 

#### Constraints
We are limited to study school performance data only from the years 2010-2012. We cannot know all the measures that districts employed during these years or their effect on performance. We are not experts of education and are creating a story with limited knowledge of the features. 

#### Stakeholders
The key stakeholder here is The Colorado State Board of Education. Ultimately, other stakeholders include district boards, school boards, teachers, parents, and students.

### #Data
1. Visualize the State of Public Education in Colorado | Kaggle: Student performance, college-readiness, and demographic information by school for the years 2010-2012 
2. School District Revenues and Expenditures | CDE (state.co.us): Revenue and expenditures by program and district for the years 2010-2012
3. SAIPE Datasets (census.gov): The number of students whose families below the poverty level by district for the years 2010-2012

#### Outline
Describe how the overall performance of the state has changed over the past years and break it down by districts, school level, type of school using visualization
Compare the number of students in poverty, the number of students receiving discounted lunches, and the amount of money being spent in support programs.
Examine the performance of students in minorities to make recommendations of outreach programs.
Demonstrate evidence for the effect of expenditures as well as their types on performance with hypothesis testing
Use clustering to compare performance, demographic information, or geographic location
